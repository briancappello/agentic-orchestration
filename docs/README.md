# Documentation

How the parts fit:

```
  people ──► workbench ──► Sortie ──► acp-broker ──► agent (ACP)
     │          │            │             ▲
     │          └─► tracker ◄┘             │
     └──────────── watch and steer ────────┘
```

The workbench writes the approved plan into the tracker through Sortie.
Sortie runs an agent session for each released story, with `acp-broker`
in front of the agent. People watch and steer those sessions from the
workbench, which reaches each broker over HTTP.
