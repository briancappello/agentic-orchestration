You are working on story **{{ .issue.identifier }}**: {{ .issue.title }}

{{ if .issue.description }}{{ .issue.description }}{{ end }}

The repository is checked out in the current directory, on the story's
branch. Read its `AGENTS.md` first and follow it. Change the code to meet the
story's acceptance criteria, add or update tests, and run the repository's
checks for what you changed until they pass. Keep the change focused on this
story.

The story's spec, if it has one, is in the description above: implement every
requirement it covers and give each scenario a test. Finish the whole story
across as many turns as it takes. Stop early, with `needs-human-review` and
the reason, only when you are blocked on something only a person can decide
or provide; work that is merely large or still missing is not a reason.

Commit your work with git, in conventional commits, with no AI attribution.
Do not push and do not open a pull request: Sortie does both after the run.
Only committed work leaves this machine. Before you finish, write
`.sortie/pr.json` with a JSON object holding a short `title` and a `body`
that says what changed and how you proved it.
