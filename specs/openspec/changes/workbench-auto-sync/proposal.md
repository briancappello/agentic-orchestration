## Why

A person approves a story, then has to open **Sync…**, read a preview and
confirm it before the story reaches the tracker and an agent. The confirmation
guards nothing the approval does not already guard:

- a sync writes only approved stories, and skips drafts;
- it never deletes an issue, never reassigns one, and changes an issue's state
  only to release it (`sortie/plan-sync`, "What a sync never does");
- an edit to a released story withdraws its approval and pulls it back
  (`planning/release-gate`).

So the one consequential effect of a sync, an agent starting, is decided by
**Approve**. The dialog asks the same question twice and adds minutes of delay.
Then the released story waits for Sortie's next poll.

## What Changes

- **The approved plan reaches the tracker on its own.** About a second after
  an approval, a pull-back, a cancel, a supersede, or a change to the spec
  store that alters the validated graph, the workbench syncs the project
  through Sortie's preview and apply, with no confirmation. One sync runs at a
  time per project, and changes during a run cause exactly one more.
- **A release starts work at once.** After a sync that released a story, the
  workbench asks Sortie to poll now (`POST /api/v1/refresh`), so dispatch
  does not wait for the poll interval.
- **The Sync button and dialog go away.** In their place is a sync status in
  the top bar: syncing, synced with its time, or failed with the reason and a
  retry. It opens the last sync's result: what was created, updated,
  released, and orphaned.
- **Failures are visible and retried.** An invalid plan, an unreachable
  Sortie, a tracker without a needed capability, or a partial failure stops
  the sync and shows why. A failed sync is retried with backoff, and again on
  the next change.
- **BREAKING (workbench UI):** there is no preview step. Sortie's
  preview-and-apply API is unchanged; the workbench calls both steps itself.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

### Modified Capabilities

- `planning/plan-workbench`: "Sync with preview" is replaced by "The approved
  plan syncs on its own" and "Sync status".

## Impact

- `workbench/`: a per-project sync loop in the backend (`sync.py`, `hub.py`),
  a sync-status endpoint and event, the top bar and the removal of
  `SyncDialog.svelte`, `dev/live` and the operator guide.
- Sortie: none. It already has preview, apply and `POST /api/v1/refresh`.
